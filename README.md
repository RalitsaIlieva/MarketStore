The input is as follows: 
  1. On the first line on the Console we write a string which is the type of the card: bronze, silver or gold (no matter of the letters - capital or not);
  2. On the second line we write a decimal which is the turnover;
  3. On the third line we write a decimal which is the purchase value.
We create an instance of Card class which is the parent class of other three classes of cards. Depending on the type of the card, we make this instance of class Bronze, Silver or Gold using the polymorphism. Then we find the discount rate, the discount and the total purchase value which are based on the GetDiscountRate method that is different for the different types of card.
